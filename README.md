# IITB-RISC-MICROPROCESSOR-DESIGN
Prof. Virendra Singh | Course: Microprocessor           [April’24]

• Designed a 16-bit, 8 register Computer System using a single cycle based implementation, capable of
efficiently performing 24 different types of instructions, based on the given Instruction Set Architecture.

• Designed the flowcharts, datapaths and the control logic, and implemented the processor using VHDL

• Facilitated the design of the 6 stage pipeline based Implementation of the processor for better performance
